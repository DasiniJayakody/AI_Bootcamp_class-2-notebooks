    "In this notebook we’ll learn how to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) directly using the **OpenAI Python SDK**.  \n",
    "This is the **first time** we’re exploring API interactions, so we’ll build up gradually:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize** the client with your API key.  \n",
    "2. **Minimal call** to the API (Responses API).  \n",
    "3. Use **Chat Completions** for system + user roles.  \n",
    "4. Explore **temperature** (randomness) and **top_p** (nucleus sampling).  \n",
    "5. Add **system prompts** to guide behavior.  \n",
    "6. Try **streaming tokens** (like ChatGPT typing).  \n",
    "7. Get **JSON/structured outputs** with schemas.  \n",
    "8. Handle **errors, timeouts, and retries** gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you’ll know how to **call an LLM safely and flexibly** using just the OpenAI SDK."

Bruno, on the other hand, was a large, friendly golden retriever with a heart as big as his paws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite their differences, the two animals enjoyed a curious friendship. They lived next door to each other; Whiskers claimed the warm windowsill of her owner's home, while Bruno basked in the sun on his porch. Every day, they would meet at the split fence that separated their yards, exchanging stories and planning their next adventure.\n",
      "\n",
      "One sunny afternoon, as the birds chirped merrily, Whiskers proposed a daring idea. “Let’s go on an exploration to the old mill at the edge of the woods! I’ve heard tales of treasures hidden there,” she said, her eyes sparkling with excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bruno’s tail wagged enthusiastically. “I’m in! How do we get there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a flick of her tail, Whiskers devised a route through the gardens and down the winding path that led to the woods. Together, they set off, Whiskers leading the way with her agile leaps, while Bruno lumbered after her, his playful bark echoing through the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they approached the mill, a sense of adventure tingled in the air. The old structure loomed ahead, cloaked in vines and secrets. The door creaked open at their approach, revealing a dusty interior filled with cobwebs and scattered wooden beams. Whiskers ducked inside, her keen eyes scanning the dark corners. Bruno hesitated, unsure of the looming shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, Bruno! There’s nothing to be afraid of!” Whiskers called, her voice echoing in the silence. She spotted a glint beneath a wooden floorboard and scampered over.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a nudge from Bruno, she pried the board open, revealing a small, rusted tin box. Together, they tugged it free, excitement bubbling between them. What could it be? They opened it cautiously, revealing a collection of colorful marbles, sparkling as they caught the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Look at these!” Whiskers said, her voice filled with delight. “They’re beautiful!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bruno’s nose pressed closer to the marbles, and then he let out a joyful bark. “They’re perfect for playing fetch! Let’s take them home!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They spent the afternoon rolling the marbles back and forth, turning the dusty old mill into their own personal playground. Whiskers would swat them with her paw, sending them tumbling toward Bruno, who would chase after them, his tail wagging like a flag in the breeze. The laughter echoed through the woods as they played until the sun dipped low.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they finally made their way back home, marbles safely nestled under Whiskers’ paw, they exchanged contented glances. Their friendship, built on trust and adventure, shone brighter than any treasure they could have ever found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the soft glow of the evening stars, Whiskers curled up on her windowsill, and Bruno lay on his porch, dreaming of more adventures to come. In their hearts, they knew that as long as they had each other, every day would be filled with magic—real or imagined. And so, in their little corner of the world, a cat and a dog shared their days, united in friendship, forever ready to explore the unknown together.\n"
