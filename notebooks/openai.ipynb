    "In this notebook we’ll learn how to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) directly using the **OpenAI Python SDK**.  \n",
    "This is the **first time** we’re exploring API interactions, so we’ll build up gradually:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize** the client with your API key.  \n",
    "2. **Minimal call** to the API (Responses API).  \n",
    "3. Use **Chat Completions** for system + user roles.  \n",
    "4. Explore **temperature** (randomness) and **top_p** (nucleus sampling).  \n",
    "5. Add **system prompts** to guide behavior.  \n",
    "6. Try **streaming tokens** (like ChatGPT typing).  \n",
    "7. Get **JSON/structured outputs** with schemas.  \n",
    "8. Handle **errors, timeouts, and retries** gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you’ll know how to **call an LLM safely and flexibly** using just the OpenAI SDK."

      "Once in a quaint little town, there lived a plucky cat named Whiskers and a jovial dog named Buster. Whiskers, with her sleek gray fur and shimmering green eyes, prided herself on her finesse. She spent her days lounging atop a sun-drenched fence, watching the world below with a dispassionate grace. Buster, on the other hand, was a fluffy golden retriever with a heart as big as his bark. He loved nothing more than chasing butterflies and making friends with anyone he met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite their differences, Whiskers and Buster shared a common ground—the sprawling, vibrant park on the edge of town. Every afternoon, while the sun cast golden rays on the grass, they would meet at their usual spot under the grand old oak tree. Although they often looked at each other with wariness, an unspoken pact had formed between them, and they relished the comfort of each other's presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "One sunny afternoon, an unusual rustle in the bushes caught Whiskers’ keen ear. “Do you hear that, Buster?” she asked, her voice a mix of curiosity and caution. Buster perked up, his tail wagging in excitement. “Let’s investigate!” he urged, bounding toward the shrubbery.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a flick of her tail, Whiskers followed, albeit with more calculated steps. As they reached the bushes, they discovered a tiny, trembling kitten caught in a tangle of leaves. Its big blue eyes gazed up at them, filled with fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor thing,” whispered Whiskers, instinctively stepping closer. But the poor kitten flinched back, confused and scared. Buster, sensing the tension, softened his demeanor. “Hey there, little one,” he said gently. “We won’t hurt you. What’s your name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The kitten hesitated, then whispered, “Mittens.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nice to meet you, Mittens!” Buster’s sunny voice filled the air as he lowered himself, making sure he looked less intimidating. “We’re here to help!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whiskers took a deep breath. She knew that the best way to help was to use her quick thinking. “Buster, can you carefully distract the kitten while I figure out how to set her free?” With a nod, Buster began wagging his tail more vigorously, pretending to playfully chase his own tail. Mittens watched, momentarily forgetting her fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Buster engaged the kitten, Whiskers deftly approached the tangled leaves. With a gentle paw and a careful flick, she began to untangle the kitten’s fur. Mittens felt her body loosen as the tension faded, and soon, she was free.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a delighted meow, Mittens purred, rubbing against Whiskers’ legs, “Thank you! I was so scared!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whiskers purred back, surprised by her own warmth. “It was a team effort.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Buster jumped up excitedly. “Let’s play, Mittens! We can chase butterflies together!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the next few weeks, the unlikely trio became inseparable. Whiskers taught Mittens the grace of climbing trees, while Buster showed her the joys of running through the grass and barking at the wind. Their days filled with laughter and adventures, they transformed the park into their playground.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Whiskers, Buster, and Mittens lay beneath the oak tree, tired but content. Whiskers realized something she had never acknowledged before. Life wasn’t just about watching from a distance; it was about connection, friendship, and a little bit of adventure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buster nudged Whiskers and Mittens with his nose. “What should we do tomorrow?” he asked, his eyes bright with enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whiskers smiled, looking at her two dear friends. “Anything we want, as long as we do it together.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, it was the beginning of a beautiful friendship between a cat, a dog, and a kitten, reminding everyone in the little town that love knows no boundaries, and true friendship can come in all shapes and sizes.\n"
